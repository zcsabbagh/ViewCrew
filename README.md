Welcome friends! 

Social today is a little bit about a lot of people. I'm building this to help you learn a lot about very few people. 

And to reduce all friction to accessing that, I'm making this information accessible through widgets on your home screen. 

I'm starting with streaming, specifically letting you see what your friends are streaming on Netflix. The plan after that is to expand vertically through the streaming category, i.e. adding Hulu, Disney+, Prime Video, etc, before moving onto other verticals, like calendars, music, reading, etc.
